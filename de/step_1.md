## Introduction

In this project you will learn how to create a game in which you have to save the Earth from space monsters.

### What you will make

Click the green flag in the example game below to start, and then press the **left** and **right** arrow keys to move the spaceship and the **space** key to shoot.

Score as many points as you can by shooting flying space-hippos. You'll lose a life if you get hit by a hippo or by the oranges dropped by the fruit bats.
