## Lightning bolts

Let's give the spaceship the ability to fire lightning bolts!

+ Add the `Lightning` sprite from the Scratch library.

+ When the game is started, the `Lightning` sprite should be hidden until the spaceship fires its laser cannons, so add this code to the `Lightning` sprite:

```blocks
when green flag clicked
hide
```

At the moment you have a pretty gigantic lightning bolt for the spaceship to fire!

+ Attach some code below the blocks you just added to make the `Lightning` sprite smaller and to turn it upside down. Then it will look like it fires pointy end–first out of the spaceship.

```blocks
set size to (25) %
point in direction (-90 v)
```

+ Switch to the `Spaceship` sprite by clicking on it in the Sprites panel below the Stage.

+ Add some new code to make the `Spaceship` sprite create a new lightning bolt whenever the **space** key is pressed.

When the green flag is clicked Keep checking forever If the **space** key was pressed, create a clone of the `Lightning` sprite \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the blocks you will need:

end
```

+ Switch back to the `Lightning` sprite.

+ Whenever a lightning bolt is created, it should appear and then move upwards until it reaches the top of the screen. Then it should disappear.

When a new `Lightning` sprite clone appears:

+ Display it
+ Repeatedly move it up by `10` until it is touching the edge of the screen
+ Then delete the clone \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the blocks you will need:

```blocks
    when I start as a clone
    show
    repeat until <touching [edge v] ?>
        change y by (10)
    end
    delete this clone
```

+ Test your `Lightning` sprite by clicking the green flag and then pressing the **space** bar. When you press **space**, does lightning appear and move up the screen? What problem can you spot?

## title: Answer

Oops — at the moment the lightning always fires from the same place, regardless of where the spaceship is!

Add this block just before the `show`{:class="blocklooks"} block to make the clone of the `Lightning` sprite move to the `Spaceship` sprite's position before it appears. This will make it look like the lightning bolt is firing out of the spaceship.

```blocks
go to [Spaceship v]
```

\--- /collapse \---

+ Press the **space** key to test whether your lightning bolt now fires correctly.

### Challenge: fixing the lightning

What happens if you hold down the **space** key? Can you use a `wait`{:class="blockcontrol"} block to fix this?
