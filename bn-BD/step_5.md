## Space-hippos

Now you're going to add lots of flying hippos that try to destroy your spaceship.

\--- কাজ \---

Create a new sprite with the 'Hippo1' image in the Scratch library. Use the **shrink** tool to make the `Hippo` sprite a similar size to the `Spaceship` sprite.

\--- কাজ \---

Set the `Hippo` sprite's rotation style to **left-right**.

[[[generic-scratch3-sprite-rotation-style]]]

\--- /কাজ \---

\--- কাজ \---

Add some code to hide the `Hippo` sprite when the game starts.

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
hide
```

Add some code to the Stage to create a new `Hippo` clone every few seconds.

\--- hints \---

\--- hint \---

When the `green flag is clicked`{:class="block3events"}, `repeatedly`{:class="block3control"} `wait`{:class="block3control"} `between 2 and 4 seconds`{:class="block3operators"} and then `create a clone of the Hippo sprite`{:class="block3control"}.

\--- /hint \---

\--- hint \---

Here are the blocks you need:

```blocks3
forever
end

create clone of (Hippo1 v)

(pick random (2) to (4))

when flag clicked

wait () secs
```

\--- /hint \---

\--- hint \---

This is what your code should look like:

![stage sprite](images/stage-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
    wait (pick random (2) to (4)) secs
    create clone of (Hippo1 v)
end
```

\--- /hint \---

\--- /hints \---

\--- /কাজ \---

Each new hippo clone should appear at a random `x` position, and every clone should have a random speed.

\--- কাজ \---

Create a new variable called `speed`{:class="block3variables"} that is for the `Hippo` sprite only.

[[[generic-scratch3-add-variable]]]

When you've done this correctly, the variable has the name of the sprite next to it, like this:

\--- /কাজ \---

\--- কাজ \---

When each `Hippo` clone starts, pick a random speed and starting place for it. Then show the clone on the screen.

```blocks3
when I start as a clone
set [speed v] to (pick random (2) to (4))
go to x: (pick random (-220) to (220)) y: (150)
show
```

\--- /কাজ \---

\--- কাজ \---

Test your code. Does a new hippo appear every few seconds?

\--- /কাজ \---

At the moment the hippos don't move.

\--- কাজ \---

Each hippo should move around randomly until it gets hit by a lightning bolt. To make that happen, attach this code below the blocks that are already in the `Hippo` sprite's code script:

```blocks3
repeat until <touching (lightning v) ?>
    move (speed :: variables) steps
    turn right (pick random (-10) to (10)) degrees
    if on edge, bounce
end
delete this clone
```

\--- /কাজ \---

\--- কাজ \---

Test your code again. You should see a new hippo clone appear every few seconds, and each clone should move at a different speed.

Now test the spaceship's laser cannon. If a lightning bolt hits a hippo, does the hippo vanish?
