## Exploding spaceship

When a hippo touches your spaceship, the ship should explode!

+ Select the `Spaceship` sprite and rename the costume to 'normal'.

+ Draw another costume of the spaceship exploding and call it 'hit'.

Or, if you don't want to draw the explosion, you could choose the 'Sun' costume from the Scratch library, and use the **Color a shape** tool to change its colour and remove the face.

+ Add some code to your `Spaceship` sprite so that it starts off displaying the spaceship costume, but when it touches a flying hippo, it switches to the 'hit' costume:

```blocks
when flag clicked
switch costume to [normal v]
wait until <touching [Hippo1 v]>?
switch costume to [hit v]
```

+ Test your code by playing the game and colliding with a hippo. Does the spaceship change to the 'hit' costume?
